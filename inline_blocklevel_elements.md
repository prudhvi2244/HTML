# HTML Block and Inline Elements
* Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
* There are two display values: block and inline.
# Block-level Elements
* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

# Inline Elements
* An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
